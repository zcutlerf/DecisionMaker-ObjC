#  Decision Maker - Objective-C

I thought it was about time as an iOS developer that I wrestled with Objective-C. This project is a simple app that chooses a random choice for you, when you're struck by indecision.

What went well:
* I've worked with UIKit in the past, and that was helpful here. As I started to grasp the syntax, I was able to remember the properties and methods I would need to make this happen.
* Though I miss the flexibility and automatic accessibility support of SwiftUI, I was able to support dynamic font sizes, light and dark modes, high contrast mode, and accessibility labels by focusing on built-in components.

Moments of struggle:
* I had intended to create all of my views programmatically (without Storyboards). That worked for some parts of my views, but I needed a Storyboard to create a custom UITableViewCell.
* I'm missing the flexibility and automatic accessibility of SwiftUI!
